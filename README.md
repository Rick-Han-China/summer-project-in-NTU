I look through pictures and videos again, I find that the shape, frequency, color, and types of noise are different and cannot predict, such as the shape of the crack(clean) on road and the grass along the road(clean). Therefore, I have a idea that we firstly do not  classify the leaves on road, but detecting the lane line and the range of road. After finding the  road, then we can roughly say that the things that not belong to the range of road would be garbage like grass. Then we do some other things to detect whether these things are things to be cleaned or to be classify as clean.
